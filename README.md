# QuizApp
 
A simple application for a quiz. Learned from the online course Udemy - The Complete Android 10 & Kotlin Development Masterclass 2020-4 by Dennis Panjuta.

## What I learned

1. In creating your own theme, the components you use in your layouts are greatly affected by the main theme applied to the activity. In my case this cause crashes in the app. Fixed it by researching on Google. Found out that the components and the activities theme should be compatible.
2. Making intents in calling other activities.
3. Adding extra data in the intents and fetching the data from another activity
4. Using customized backgroud shapes for buttons
